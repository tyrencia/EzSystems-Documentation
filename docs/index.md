**EzDialogue** & **EzNpc** are two open-source modules that provide a quick and easy way to design, customize and implement dialogues in your game. With EzDialogue, you are able to create and initiate dialogues with humanoid and non-humanoid instances, with the choice of associating dialogues with NPCs.

EzDialogue also offers direct dialogue creation in scripts, or using prepared dialogues that can be called and loaded when needed. The best part about it is that it provides almost no limit to how much functionality and additional code you can add when initiating dialogues.

EzDialogue works by entering an accepting state of dialogue inputs when a dialogue is started, and continues to do so until it is told to end. You can continue to add dialogues in your script without yielding the thread or script.
